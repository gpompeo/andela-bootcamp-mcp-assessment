# Assessment

## Description

Build a prototype of a Customer Support chatbot for customers of a company that sells computer products (monitors, printers, etc).

The company has provided an MCP server using Streamable HTTP for accessing features they’d like to make available:

MCP_SERVER_URL=https://vipfapwm3x.us-east-1.awsapprunner.com/mcp

Please create a simple prototype and deploy it as a demo. The prototype should use a cheap LLM (flash or mini level). At a minimum, the prototype should have a demo UI and be deployed to a demo cloud like HuggingFace Spaces.

## Deliverables

Video 1: Submit a video describing the problem you've been assigned, and how you plan to solve it.

Video 2: Submit a video describing your activities so far, decisions you've made, and any challenges you've faced.

Video 3 + Full solution: Show your results and suggest how this could be further developed. This should include video + GitHub repo + chatbot URL + screenshots.
